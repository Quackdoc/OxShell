OxShell is a launcher for android. It is an attempt to recreate the feel of a classic video game system.

At the moment the feature list includes:

- Controller support
- Live wallpaper service
- Built in file explorer
- Launch roms directly into emulators that support it
- Create custom associations for roms and other files
- Install and uninstall apps
- Customizable home menu

There are many more features planned to be added, but I am just one developer so it'll likely take time for them to reach.
Please consider supporting this project by purchasing it on the store.
