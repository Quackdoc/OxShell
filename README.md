# About
OxShell is a launcher for android. It is an attempt to recreate the feel of the Sony PSP in more modern devices.

At the moment the feature list includes:

- Controller support
- Live xmb-like background
- Built in file explorer
- Launch roms directly into emulators that support it
- Install/uninstall apps

There are many more features planned to be added, but I am just one developer so it'll likely take time for them to reach.
In its current state there is no apk or release available yet as I believe it is still early in development, but if you'd like
to try this launcher anyways please follow the build instructions.
